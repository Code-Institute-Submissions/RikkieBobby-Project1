Welcome to the Readme.me for Project 1 "My First Landing Page" by Richard Nolan

Project description:
As stated in the title this project was based around creating a landing page for a future website id like to create for myself about me and the services I can provide.
My reasons for doing this were given the project is about myself, I would have enough content to fill out the page and also allow me to play around with the different elements of HTML and CSS.
Considering that this was also my first project I wanted to take the time to understand how to use Git effectively and navigating using an IDE also. 

Key Features:
- Created using HTML and CSS programmes
- A navigation bar directing users to different parts of the page
- An interactive website with information about me for users to view and explore
- Areas of the page which are responsive to user interaction
- Images linked to the project 
- A "get in contact" form
- Links to social media

How to launch the website:
- You will need access to GitHub and IDE launcher
- Go to the GitHub repository (https://github.com/RikkieBobby/Project1)
- From there you can open the Repository using GitPod, if you don't have GitPod copy the repository url and load it into your IDE
- When the repository is loaded into your IDE, go to the terminal
- Type 'python3 -m http.server' into the termianl to run a browser for the website 
- Click the open browser option which appears in your IDE
- You will now be viewing the website

Learning objectives:
-understand using HTML and CSS programmes by creating an interactive website 
-familiarize with Git and IDE launcher
-use code institute gudielines to achieve best possible grade

Future work for the project:
-seperate the website further into different pages with a range of services I offer
