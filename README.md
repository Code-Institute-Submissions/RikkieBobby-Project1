            <h4 class="textlarger">From a young age I've always enjoyed exploring the outdoors and partaking in different activities like football, skating, surfing, hiking etc. I'm also looking into getting a personal trainer to start helping me in the gym.</h4>

            <h4 class="textlarger">Again sine my youth I've had a passion for gaming ever since getting the very first playstation and playing games like Crash Bandicoot or Spyro. Later this liking for gaming would also introduce me to the world of miniature painting. An extremely relaxing and theraputic past-time I find it to be.</h4>

            <br>
            <h4 class="textlarger">And fianlly Voice Acting! Though I have yet to make any major strides in this industry, I've always had a great passion for voice actors and their work. Videos like Robin Williams rocording lines as the Genie from Alladin facinated me and I hope to in the near future give me own try and some of this line of work!</h4>
