                <p>
                    Hi, for those of you who dont know me, my name is Richard, I'm a 28 year old form Dublin and i recently decided to learn to become a software developer with Code Institutes Full Stack Developer Programme. Why sofeware development you ask? Well having returned home at Christmas 2022 after living away for some time, I thought about what I might like to do now I was home. I've always been a bit of a nerd, and enjoyed tinkering with computer in my younger years, and with the tech boom happening in Dublin at the time, a career in tech seemed more and more promising. It was around this time then that a friend of mine suggested I take a look at code Institute and their developer programme. After that a few Phone calls and some research into it, and I was enrolled into the course, I had heard that many people had landed some great careers as developvers with them, and once I was able to learn for myself, I enrolled as soon as I could. Now I start my journey into this world, and I'll begin by presenting you this landing page!

                <p>
                   As I'm sure it has for everyone, life has had its ups and downs for me throughtout the years, some more positive or negative than others. Regardless, they have helped shape me into the man I am today. Though these ideas may not be completely origional, I like to think they've sevred me well in life. Be kind to everyone you can, for you might not know whats going on behind someone elses eyes. Always try to present your best self, people will gravitate to those bring positivity into the world. Life is for living, yesterday and tomorrow will come and go, but today is your moment, so enjoy it to its fullest.
